# Product Requirements Document: 3D Model Gallery Platform

**Version:** 1.0
**Last Updated:** 2025-10-23
**Product Manager:** Claude
**Status:** Draft

---

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the requirements for a 3D Model Gallery Platform - a full-stack web application built with Nuxt 4 that enables users to browse, preview, and download 3D models. The platform prioritizes simplicity by using JSON-based configuration for content management, eliminating the need for external databases while maintaining excellent performance through SSR/SSG capabilities.

**Target Audience:** 3D artists, game developers, designers, and enthusiasts looking for quality 3D models
**Core Value Proposition:** Fast, SEO-optimized 3D model discovery with instant online previews and easy downloads

---

## Problem Statement

### Current Challenges
1. **Discovery Problem**: Users struggle to find quality 3D models across scattered resources
2. **Preview Friction**: Many platforms require downloads before users can see the actual model
3. **Performance Issues**: Heavy 3D preview systems often suffer from poor loading times
4. **SEO Limitations**: Client-side rendered galleries have poor search engine visibility
5. **Maintenance Overhead**: Traditional CMS systems add unnecessary complexity for static model catalogs

### Our Solution
A lightweight, performant 3D model gallery that:
- Provides instant online 3D previews without downloads
- Delivers fast page loads through SSR/SSG
- Maintains excellent SEO through server-side rendering
- Simplifies content management with JSON configuration
- Supports community engagement through integrated comments

## Edge Cases & Error Handling

### Edge Cases

#### EC-1: Large Model Files (> 50MB)
**Scenario:** User attempts to preview a very large 3D model
**Solution:**
- Display file size warning before preview
- Implement progressive/streaming loading
- Offer lower-poly preview version
- Provide option to skip preview and download directly

#### EC-2: Unsupported Model Format
**Scenario:** Browser doesn't support GLB/GLTF rendering
**Solution:**
- Detect WebGL support on mount
- Show static thumbnail with format info
- Suggest browser upgrade or desktop download
- Provide alternative formats (OBJ, FBX)

#### EC-3: Concurrent JSON File Updates
**Scenario:** Multiple users download simultaneously, download counter conflicts
**Solution:**
- Implement file locking mechanism in Nitro API
- Use atomic write operations
- Alternative: Move analytics to separate append-only log file
- Consider rate limiting on analytics endpoints

#### EC-4: Broken Model Files
**Scenario:** Corrupted or missing .glb files
**Solution:**
- Validate file existence on build/startup
- Implement model validation script (checks file integrity)
- Show error state with report button
- Log errors to admin dashboard

#### EC-5: Search Result Overload
**Scenario:** Search query returns 500+ results
**Solution:**
- Implement virtual scrolling for large result sets
- Cap results at 100 with "refine search" prompt
- Add "Load More" button instead of pagination
- Index optimization for search performance

#### EC-6: Comment System Downtime
**Scenario:** Giscus/GitHub is unavailable
**Solution:**
- Graceful degradation: hide comment section
- Show "Comments temporarily unavailable" message
- Implement retry logic with exponential backoff
- Cache comment count for offline display

### Error States

| Error Type | User Message | Technical Action |
|-----------|--------------|------------------|
| Model Load Failure | "Unable to load 3D preview. View thumbnail instead?" | Log error, show fallback |
| Download Failure | "Download failed. Please try again." | Retry with exponential backoff |
| Search Timeout | "Search taking longer than expected..." | Show partial results |
| No Results | "No models found. Try different filters." | Show suggested models |
| Network Error | "Connection lost. Some features may be limited." | Enable offline mode |

---

## Technical Constraints

### Must Adhere To
1. **Nuxt 4 Framework**: All features must use Nuxt 4 conventions and APIs
2. **No External Database**: All data persists in JSON files
3. **File-based Storage**: Models stored in `/public/models` directory
4. **SSR/SSG Rendering**: Model pages must be pre-rendered or server-rendered
5. **JSON Configuration**: Model metadata managed via JSON files only
6. **Third-party Comments**: Cannot build custom comment backend

### Limitations & Tradeoffs

#### Storage Limitations
- **Constraint:** Local JSON files not suitable for 10,000+ models
- **Limit:** Recommend max 500-1000 models before migration needed
- **Mitigation:** Implement pagination and search indexing early

#### Concurrent Write Issues
- **Constraint:** JSON file writes not atomic by default
- **Risk:** Download counter corruption with high traffic
- **Mitigation:** Implement file locking or move to append-only logs

#### Search Performance
- **Constraint:** Client-side search slow with 500+ models
- **Limit:** Full-text search requires backend solution at scale
- **Mitigation:** Use Fuse.js for fuzzy search, implement search indexing

#### 3D Preview Bandwidth
- **Constraint:** Large model files consume significant bandwidth
- **Impact:** Hosting costs increase with traffic
- **Mitigation:** Implement CDN, optimize models, offer LOD versions

---

## Security & Privacy

### Data Privacy
- **No User Data Collection**: No login system (except comment OAuth)
- **Analytics**: Only aggregate download counts stored
- **Cookies**: Only used for theme preference (localStorage preferred)
- **GDPR Compliance**: No personal data collected = minimal compliance burden

### Content Security
- **File Upload**: Not applicable (admin manages files directly)
- **XSS Protection**: Sanitize user-generated content (comments via Giscus)
- **CORS Policy**: Restrict model file hotlinking if needed
- **License Enforcement**: Display license prominently, include in downloads

### Infrastructure Security
- **Environment Variables**: API keys for analytics/comments in `.env`
- **Git Security**: Never commit `/data/*.json` if contains sensitive info
- **Access Control**: Server-side validation for download endpoints
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevent download abuse (Nitro rate limiter)

---

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk

#### R1: 3D Performance on Low-end Devices
- **Probability:** High
- **Impact:** Critical (core feature unusable)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Test on minimum spec devices (2015 mid-range phones)
  - Implement progressive enhancement (fallback to thumbnails)
  - Add "Skip 3D Preview" option for slow connections
  - Use model-viewer's built-in optimizations

#### R2: Model File Hosting Costs
- **Probability:** Medium
- **Impact:** High (budget overrun)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Estimate bandwidth: 100 models × 5MB avg × 1000 downloads = 500GB/month
  - Use CDN with free tier (Cloudflare)
  - Implement hotlink protection
  - Monitor bandwidth usage weekly

### Medium Risk

#### R3: JSON File Scale Limitations
- **Probability:** Medium
- **Impact:** Medium (requires refactoring)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Document migration path to database (SQLite/Postgres)
  - Design data layer abstraction early
  - Set hard limit at 1000 models in documentation
  - Monitor JSON file parse performance

#### R4: Comment System Dependency
- **Probability:** Low
- **Impact:** Medium (feature unavailable)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Choose reliable provider (GitHub/Disqus)
  - Implement graceful degradation
  - Design comment section as isolated component
  - Have backup provider configured

### Low Risk

#### R5: Browser Compatibility
- **Probability:** Low
- **Impact:** Low (small user segment)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Support modern browsers only (last 2 versions)
  - Display compatibility warning on old browsers
  - Provide static fallbacks for critical features
